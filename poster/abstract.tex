In biomedical imaging, between-subject comparability is attained at the voxel level via image registration.
This process requires several data preparation steps, of which brain extraction is particularly problematic in preclinical applications.
Current solutions rely on human brain extraction library adaptations, or full image processing â€” with introduce artefacts via rostrocaudal cropping and peripheral hyperintensities, respectively.

We present a deep learning framework for multi-contrast MRI brain tissue segmentaion, and benchmark its performance with respect to novel workflow advances.
