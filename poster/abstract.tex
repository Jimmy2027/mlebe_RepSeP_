In biomedical imaging, between-subject comparability is attained at the voxel level via image registration.
This process requires several data preparation steps, of which tissue segmentation remains challenging in preclinical research.
In preclinical neuroimaging, the process of brain extraction is the simplest tissue segmentation process, yet, remains insufficiently accurate in extant registration workflows.
On account of this, current solutions rely on human brain extraction library adaptations, which introduce artefacts via rostrocaudal cropping.
Further, advanced workflows aware of brain extraction shortcomings may forego this stem entirely, and insted introduce registration optimizations aiming to function without prior brain extraction --- which may nonetheless remain susceptible to non-brain-tissue hyperintensities.

Here, we present a deep learning framework for multi-contrast MRI brain tissue classification, and benchmark its performance with respect to improving state-of-the-art registration workflows.
